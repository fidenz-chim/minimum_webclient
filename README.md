Simplest possible browser based app using HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript

If you are a programmer wihtout frontend app development experience using HTML/CSS/JavaScript, this would be quiet helpful.
This has no dependencies/frameworks/libraries used (except the CSS from W3Schools.com which has no impact but gives a better UI)
so ideal for prototyping/learning.
